    <h1>COMPUTER</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      A computer is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine">machine</a> that can be
      programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_operations">operations</a>
      (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can
      perform generic sets of operations known as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">programs</a>.
      These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A
      computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the
      hardware,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"
        >operating system</a
      >
      (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full
      operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are
      linked and function together, such as a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network"
        >computer network</a
      >
      or computer cluster. A broad range of industrial and consumer products use
      computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like
      microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices
      like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as
      general-purpose devices like
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"
        >personal computer</a
      >
      and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which
      links billions of other computers and users.

    <p>
      Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing
      element, typically a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"
        >centeral processing unit</a
      >
      (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory"
        >computer memory</a
      >
      typically semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out
      arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can
      change the order of operations in response to stored
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">information</a> Peripheral
      devices include input devices (keyboards, mice,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick">joystick</a>, etc.),
      output devices (monitor screens,<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing)"
        >printers</a
      >
      , etc.), and input/output devices that perform both functions (e.g., the
      2000s-era
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen">touchscreen</a> ).
      Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external
      source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.

      <li>Analog computer</li>
      <li>Digital computer</li>
      <li>Hybrid computer</li>
      <li>Super computer</li>

    <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are
      tangible physical objects. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_network">circuits</a> , computer chips, graphic cards, sound
      cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables,
      keyboards, printers and "mice" input devices are all hardware.

    </dl>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>
      Software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material
      form, such as programs, data, protocols, etc. Software is that part of a
      computer system that consists of encoded information or computer
      instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system
      is built. Computer software includes computer programs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">laibraries</a> and
      related non-executable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">data</a> , such as online documentation or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media">digital media</a> . It is often divided into system software and application software
      Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be
      realistically used on its own. When software is stored in hardware that
      cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible
      computer, it is sometimes called "firmware".
